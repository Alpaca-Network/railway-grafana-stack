# Pyroscope configuration for GatewayZ monitoring stack
#
# Pyroscope is a continuous profiling backend.  The gatewayz-backend FastAPI
# process pushes CPU/memory flamegraph samples here every 15 s via the
# pyroscope-io Python SDK.  Grafana reads them back via the Pyroscope datasource.
#
# All communication is internal to the Railway project — port 4040 is never
# exposed publicly.

server:
  http_listen_port: 4040

# Store profiles on the local filesystem volume.
# Railway persists volumes across deploys, so profiles survive restarts.
storage:
  backend: filesystem
  filesystem:
    dir: /data/pyroscope

# Scrape configs are empty — GatewayZ uses the push model (SDK → Pyroscope),
# not the pull model (Pyroscope → target /debug/pprof).
